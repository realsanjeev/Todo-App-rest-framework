## Todo Task API 

The **Todo Task API Framework** provides robust API responses tailored for seamless integration with front-end web applications, such as React.js projects. It utilizes `rest_framework` to enable essential features:

**1. Authentication**: Secure interactions are ensured through token-based authentication, leveraging `rest_framework`'s authentication system.

**2. CRUD Operations**: Authenticated users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. Customizable permissions and authentication settings cater to specific project needs.

**3. Pagination**: Built-in pagination optimizes data transfer, enhancing user experience by efficiently managing large datasets between the backend and frontend.

**4. Search Functionality**: Users can easily search for specific records using query parameters, improving data retrieval efficiency.

**5. Dedicated API Endpoints**: Each operation is supported by dedicated API endpoints, facilitating direct interaction between the frontend application and backend API.


## Todo App

The Todo App is a task management application designed for creating, deleting, and tracking task completion status. It combines basic frontend functionality with additional features accessible through its REST API.
